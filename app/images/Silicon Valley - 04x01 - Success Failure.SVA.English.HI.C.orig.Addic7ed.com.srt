00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,979
No, I'll get my car tomorrow.
I had too many.

2
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:14,686
Got an Uber coming. Thank you.

3
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:19,014
That was fast.

4
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,354
Hello. For Jim?

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
RICHARD: Yep.

6
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:27,279
Oh, would you... would
you care for a water?

7
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:30,075
Why are your fingers orange?

8
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:31,787
It's... It's iodine.

9
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:33,327
I've been... biting my nails,

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,040
so I put this on there to
stop me from doing it.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Looks like Cheetos, tastes like asshole.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,960
So, what do you do?

13
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,713
Venture capital over at Wood Opal.

14
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:45,255
Wow.

15
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:46,889
Wow. Good.

16
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:49,095
- Mm-hmm.

17
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,266
Uh, can I take this?

18
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:52,765
- Sure.
- All right.

else out there on the market.</i>

22
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:01,475
I agree.

23
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:04,603
Yes, and you can add
multiple concurrent users

24
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:08,231
with no loss in picture quality,
even on conventional 3G.

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,450
Let's see what happens
when we add more friends.

<i>Hi, friend. What's up?</i>

27
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,242
<i>Hello, friend.</i>

add another friend?</i>

29
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:19,209
<i>Yeah, we should.</i>

30
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:21,999
<i>How many friends can we
conference at the same time?</i>

31
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:25,124
Well, thanks to the
amazing new TURN server,

32
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,672
as many as you like.

Well, let's find out.

38
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:38,185
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

39
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:39,726
Yeah, got it. I'm on it.

40
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,020
<i>Hey, friends.</i>

41
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:43,603
<i>Wow! Look at that. The
image is so clear.</i>

42
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,399
<i>We all look amazing, don't we?</i>

43
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:46,982
<i>- Yeah, we really do.
- Yes.</i>

44
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:49,067
Is that really just on a cell signal?

45
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:50,232
Uh, yes.

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,450
This is the amazing new
company PiperChat.

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,789
Wait a minute.

48
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:58,917
I saw you at TechCrunch.
You're Richard Hendricks.

49
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:01,205
- The very same. Yeah.
- You're the fucking guy

- No!
- GILFOYLE:<i> Uh-oh.</i>

00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,167
- JARED: <i>That was my fault.</i>
- Yes, but no.

54
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:09,584
I mean, that... that's the old thing.
This is the new thing,

55
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,173
and I can assure you,
it's very, very real.

56
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,928

- Look, look.

58
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:18,476
No one will even talk
to us, which is crazy.

59
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:21,267
We just surpassed 120,000
daily active users

60
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:25,061
and we're growing at a rate of 18
percent, organically, week over week.

00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:35,233
<i>Okay, for real, Richard.
You have to pull over.</i>

68
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:37,533
<i>- Richard, do not... do not pull over.
- You'll never see him again.</i>

No. It's the locks. I... I don't know.

We are desperate. We need funding.

00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:59,176

- Yes.

be trying to kidnap you.

00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,689
Problem solved.

these servers are costing me</i>

86
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,062
<i>just to keep this ship afloat?</i>

87
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:16,984
<i>Right, and every new user
increases our server cost.</i>

Really? I'm sorry.

00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,789

DINESH: Yeah, I just pushed my code.

104
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:58,447
Took me two fucking days,

105
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:00,742
but I broke up our entire code
base into parallel services.

106
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:02,496
You know, this whole job
would've been a lot easier

107
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:04,877
if you hadn't designed sloppy
services in the first place.

Oh, silly me.

00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,496
I guess when I hacked together

00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,452
the video chat as an in-house tool,

111
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:12,123
I didn't foresee that hundreds
of thousands of people

112
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:15,172
would shit themselves over
how fucking awesome it was.

113

You're not paying us at all.

Well, you should bear 100
percent of the company's cost,

123
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,947
seeing as you do own 100
percent of the company.

What's taking you so long to
give us our fucking shares?

Well, Your Highness, could
you please push your code?

00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:02,676
Well, I couldn't push that code,

134
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:05,262
because I didn't write that code.

135
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,808
What? We stayed up for two fucking days.

136
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:09,263
Why didn't you write your code?

137
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:12,142
Well, because I was working
on something much better.

138
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,940
(LAUGHS)

139
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:17,234
So, I started to optimize our
code to handle higher tr...

140
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,573
You're supposed to follow me.

141
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:22,866
Oh.

142
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:25,409
I, uh, I started to optimize our code

143
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:26,783
to handle higher traffic.

144
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,250
Then it occurred to me,
why rewrite our old code

145
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,871
when I can build a new encoder

146
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,048
that doesn't strip away a ton
of channels and metadata.

147
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:39,468
So, I extended my compression algorithm

148
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,849
to support... get this... 12-bit color.

149
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,349
(LAUGHS)

150
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,480
Okay, so our users will
be able to experience

151
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:51,058
a 10 percent increase in image quality

152
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:54,604
with absolutely no increase
in server load whatsoever.

153
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,739
Just-Just-Just... Just watch this.

154
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,526
Before.

155
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,570
After.

156
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:00,983
Before.

157
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:02,481
After.

158
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:05,282
Richard, I'm trying very hard

159
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:07,617
not to completely lose
my shit right now.

160
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:08,822
I get it. I get it.

161
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:11,702
After every VC in town turned us down,

162
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,960
we decided that the
best way to stay alive

163
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:19,583
until we got to a million users
was to cut server usage.

164
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:20,793
Remember that?

165
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:22,712
The whole reason that Gilfoyle and I

166
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,131
stayed up for 48 fucking straight hours

167
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,440
was to decrease server load,

168
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,595
not keep it the same.

169
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:32,724
Technically, the reason why
we stayed up for two days

170
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,221
was to maximize our ability
to get a million users,

171
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:36,933
and I just did that.

172
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:40,353
Because who doesn't want 10
percent better image quality?

173
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,443

Okay. Well, I haven't really
thought this through, so...

361
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,981
Okay.

362
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:23,981
- I own a telescope...
- Of course you do.

363
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:27,993
and I brought it out one
night to look at the full moon.

364
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:30,577
- Of course you did.
- And I got to thinking...

365
00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:34,084
"Wow, we put a man on the moon

366
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:37,127
using the computing power
of a handheld calculator."

367
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:40,544
And then I thought, "Okay...

368
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:43,801
"there's literally millions of times

369
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,805
"more computing power in my phone

370
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:48,847
and that's just sitting in my
pocket doing nothing." Right?

371
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:52,391
So then I thought, there's,
what, billions of phones

372
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:55,147
all around the world with
the same computing power

373
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:57,109
just sitting in people's pockets.

374
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,490
So then I thought, "What
if we use all those phones

375
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,449
to build a massive network?"

376
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,409
And here's the kicker... We
use my compression algorithm

377
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:09,151
to make everything small and efficient
to move things around, and...

378
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:11,786
if we could do it...

379
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:15,541
we could build a completely
decentralized version

380
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:18,205

with no firewalls,

there might be a better way.

542

I'm going to start my own company.

543
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:04,449
I will give up all of my
equity in the video chat

544
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:09,203
if I get to completely own my algorithm.

545
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:12,168

a perpetual license

546
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,089
to use the algorithm in your video chat,

547
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:17,258
but I need the algorithm
to build something else.

548
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:19,338
And look, forget a million users,

549
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:20,713

550
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,559

raise money, no problem.

551
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:24,425
And that way, everybody wins.

552
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:29,011
So we can use the algorithm,
free and clear, for video chat?

553
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,133
Yes.

554
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:32,440
I mean, we... we shouldn't
even be talking about this.

555
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:35,229
And you would leave
behind your 25 percent,

556
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:39,524
thus giving me enough equity
to compensate the boys fairly

557
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,910
and Big Head's father would
retain his 50 percent?

558

I think that's right. Yes.

559
00:22:43,324 --> 00:22:45,744
And I would own 10 percent
of your new company.

560

561
